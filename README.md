# SkinCheck Bot by Yumna Imam

SkinCheck Bot is an AI-powered web app designed for early skin cancer detection and public health education. Developed during a healthcare-focused hackathon, it uses a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze skin lesion images and predict whether they are benign or malignant. The tool also answers skin cancer‚Äìrelated questions, combining AI predictions with symptom education drawn from real clinical datasets.

The model runs directly in Google Colab and is wrapped in an interactive Gradio interface, making it lightweight, fast to deploy, and accessible for both patients and clinicians. By integrating clinical data from real cancer cases, the app can also display relevant patient information alongside each prediction.

### üöÄ Key Features

- Upload a lesion image for real-time classification (Benign / Malignant)
- Trained using TensorFlow on curated skin cancer image data
- Pulls patient info from MINDS dataset for reference
- AI-powered chatbot answers user questions about skin cancer
- No install needed ‚Äî launches in browser via Google Colab and Gradio

### üß† Technologies Used

- Python + TensorFlow (CNN)
- Gradio (Web UI)
- Pandas + NumPy
- Clinical patient datasets (CSV)
- Google Colab (Deployment)
